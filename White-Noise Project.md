# Original Idea
For my poem I want to visualize what it's like when you are too much in your own thoughts. As a person keeps looping about in their own mind
their thoughts get more and more clouded and sometimes all you need to clear it is for someone there to snap you out of it.

# What I wanted to do

In order to do this I set up a canvas in p5.js where I us perlin noise to create waves. The waves start off slow and steady but as it continues
It rages on and gets more out of control. 
In order to calm it down, a voice needs to be heard which will make it hard reset.
I wanted to use a mic or knock sensor that will sense a person's voice.
The sound will be set to a value and only when the value is high enough does it register in the canvas



# Discoveries/Confusions
I have less expereince working with sound so it's a bit diffucult to figure how the values will work properly.

I haven't gotten it to work yet due to my mic not picking anything up.

# How it actually works
Haven't been able to get it to work yet.

this is the code that I figure could work:
Here is concept code for the wave without any audio inputs
