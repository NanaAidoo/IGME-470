##Pop Jenga
Team: Nana Aidoo, Zach Brown, Steven Mills

Our game idea is to make a jenga game using stress bricks.
The objective is the same as regular Jenga. You don't want to knock down the tower.
The catch is the floor surrounding the tower is covered with bubble sheets

There are sound sensors throught the floor which are set to a specific loud sound,
specifically anything higher than the sound bubble wrap popping

If the sensors are activated then it triggers motors underneath the tower which will cause the tower to shake
