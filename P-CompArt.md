# Who Dunnit and how it was made
The Pool is made by interactive light artist Jen Lewin. 
It's created by using floor pads that are composed of a wirelesss controller, LEDs, a micro-controller as well as sensor array. When a person stands on the pad, the pad will react based on several factors like how fast it was stepped on, how hard it was stepped on, and where the foot landed. The LEDs on the pad will then change based on the information from the array. The pad then sends the information from it to the other pads within it's vicinity using the wireless controllers in each of them. Despite this, the pads are not hard functioned in their reactions, they all act independantly of each other and only react when they get the information from the outside.

# What is the insperation and who is it aimed at
Jen Lewis was inspired when she was walking on a beach and saw pools of water left over by the tide reflecting the light of the moon. It was so beautiful to her that she wanted to replicate it. However she didn't want it to just be a display that people would come to look and admire, she wanted the people to actually be apart of the experience. It's created as work that everyone can be a part of or would be curious about with.

# What experience does it create
The Pool was made to be a communitative sort of experience. When you first come across it, you might just be thinking about all the stuff you can do by yourself. You want to find out what will happen if you step on it harder or if you try and hop around the space more, but as you're doing it you will slowly become aware to not only the people around but also their actions and how it's affecting both their enviroment and yours. This could lead you into either wanting to copy their actions, if you're sociable enough, you could even ask them to try out different motions with you, or it might just inspire you to bring a group of friends with you so you can all have fun together. Jen wanted people not only to experience something close to the beauty she saw that day but to also help either make new connections or strengthing existing ones by intereacting with The Pool.
