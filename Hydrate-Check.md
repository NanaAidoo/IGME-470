# Original Idea
My Idea is for my project is for an experience where you have a certain amount of time to drink water before a timer goes off. My goal is that this experience will help generate healthy hydration habits as it is too easy, especially for people busy with either work or school work, to avoid keeping oneself hydrated through out the day. When the timer runs out a sound goes off. The sound would be attention grabbing but not too unpleasant. If the user picks up the water bottle before time runs out then the timer resets from the beginning, this shows that the user is improving their drinking habits. Even if they just pick up the bottle to stop the timer it makes them acknowledge the water bottle and consider drinking from it.

# What I wanted to do

I wanted to make a countdown program(using P5.js) where the user chooses the amount of time they want and then the timer starts. 
The timer will reset if they ever pick of the bottle before time runs out without any notification goes out.
If the timer goes off, a sound is played and the canvas will go back andforth between two colors which will get the user's attention that they need to drink their water.

I wanted to attach knock sensors to a water bottle as a way to detect whether or not the bottle had been lifted up at all


# Discoveries/Confusions
I just couldn't find the time nor motivation to apply my idea into an actual project.
