# Original Idea
For my poem I want to visualize what it's like when you are too much in your own thoughts. As a person keeps looping about in their own mind
their thoughts get more and more clouded and sometimes all you need to clear it is for someone there to snap you out of it.

# What I wanted to do

I wanted to make a countdown program(using P5.js) where the user chooses the amount of time they want and then the timer starts. 
The timer will reset if they ever pick of the bottle before time runs out without any notification goes out.
If the timer goes off, a sound is played and the canvas will go back andforth between two colors which will get the user's attention that they need to drink their water.

I wanted to attach knock sensors to a water bottle as a way to detect whether or not the bottle had been lifted up at all


# Discoveries/Confusions
I just couldn't find the time nor motivation to apply my idea into an actual project.
