# Original Idea
For my poem I want to visualize what it's like when you are too much in your own thoughts. As a person keeps looping about in their own mind
their thoughts get more and more clouded and sometimes all you need to clear it is for someone there to snap you out of it.

# What I wanted to do

In order to do this I set up a canvas in p5.js where I us perlin noise to create waves. The waves start off slow and steady but as it continues
It rages on and gets more out of control. 
In order to calm it down, a voice needs to be heard which will make it hard reset.
I wanted to use a mic or knock sensor that will sense a person's voice.
The sound will be set to a value and only when the value is high enough does it register in the canvas
