# What I wanted to do
I wanted to create a demo where there are three different types of light sequences going on

A button sequence which is just a simple function where when the button is pressed, the light turns on

A switch that when iy is flipped on, an LED is flashing on and off every three seconds

Lastly, simple function where a random number is called between 0 and 20 and if the number is less than 10, the LED on the arduino turns on

# Discoveries/Confusions
It's most likely the way my circuits were made but only one of my switches work consistently but not fully. However the light functions I made do work so I at least know that all of them work properly.

# How it actually works
I don't have it working due to missing parts

this is the code that I figure could work:
