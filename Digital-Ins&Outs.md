# What I wanted to do
I wanted to create a demo where there are three different types of light sequences going on

A button sequence which is just a simple function where when the button is pressed, the light turns on

A switch that when iy is flipped on, an LED is flashing on and off every three seconds

Lastly, simple function where a random number is called between 0 and 20 and if the number is less than 10, the LED on the arduino turns on

# Discoveries/Confusions
Nothing as I haven't implemented it yet

# How it actually works
I don't have it working due to missing parts

this is the code that I figure could work:
